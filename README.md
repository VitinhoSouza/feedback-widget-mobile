## Techs:
Built a React Native + TypeScript model with expo. Also used:
- The “react-native-gesture-handler” library to handle gestures;
- The “react-native-iphone-x-helper” library to fix a size adjustment on iPhones;
- The “react-native-view-shot” + “expo-file-system” libraries for screenshot + conversion functionality respectively.
- The “phosphor-react-native” library for using icons;
- “@gorhom/bottom-sheet” to use BottomSheet as a modal;
- “@expo-google-fonts/inter” to use app fonts;
- Axios to consume the backend route.

## Get started:
- Open the terminal inside the project folder and do: 'npm install' or 'yarn add'. When all packages are installed, do 'npm start' or 'yarn start' to start in development mode.
